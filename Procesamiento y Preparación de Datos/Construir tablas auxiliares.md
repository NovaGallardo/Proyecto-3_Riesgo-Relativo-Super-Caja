# Construir tablas auxiliares

<aside>
üí° Al unir todas las tablas, hay 425 filas con nulos debido a la tabla loans_outstanding. Se obtendr√° la mediana de total_loans seg√∫n cada cuartil de last_month_salary y con eso se imputar√°n los datos. Adem√°s, se obtienen los cuartiles de variables importantes.
